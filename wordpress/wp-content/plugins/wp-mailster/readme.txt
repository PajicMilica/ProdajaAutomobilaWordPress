WP Mailster allows your users to be part of a group and communicate by email without having to log into a website.

== Description ==

WP Mailster allows your users to be part of a group and communicate by email without having to log into a website.
Similar to programs like Mailman or Listserv this plugin allows you to run a discussion mailing list.

That means that every email sent to a central email address is forwarded to the rest of the members of the list.
When members reply to such emails WP Mailster again forwards them to the other list recipients.
Unlike newsletter plugins this allows true two-way communication via email.

Features include:

*   group communication through email
*   usable with any POP3/IMAP email account
*   recipients can be managed in the WordPress admin area
*   users can subscribe/unsubscribe through widgets on the website
*   all WP users can be chosen as recipients, additional recipients can be stored (without having to create them as WP users)
*   users can be organized in groups
*   single users or whole groups can be added as recipients of a mailing list
*   replies to mailing list messages can be forwarded to all recipients (or only the sender)
*   email archive for browsing the mails
*   full support of HTML emails and attachments
*   custom headers and footers
*   subject prefixes
*   many more features

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wp-mailster` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the WP Mailster screen to configure the plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I send an email? =
When you want to use WP Mailster you don't need to browse to a website, login and do something to send the message there - you just use your favorite mail client.
Simply write an email to the mailing list's address - and nothing else. So use Gmail, Outlook, Thunderbird, a Webmailer, any way you like - just send it to the mailing list address you have setup in WP Mailster.

= Why take the emails so long to be delivered? How can I speed up sending?  =
WP Mailster is a part of WordPress which is a PHP based web application. That means: it can not act/run without being triggered and it can not run forever when triggered. This is a technical limitation coming from PHP, not from WP Mailster or WordPress.
Triggering means that somebody accesses the site. During the page load WP Mailster is handling the jobs to do (mail retrieving/sending). Thus mails can only be send/retrieved when somebody is browsing your site, otherwise the delivery is delayed or never done. As your site might not be browsed every few minutes 24Ã—7 we recommend you to use a cronjob that opens the site periodically. We have a guide on our website on how to set that up.

= What are send errors?  =
The send errors are messages your email server is giving back to WP Mailster basically saying "I will not forward this message". Then WP Mailster sending for some time but eventually stops which is what you see happening.
The cause can be a lot of things, e.g. hitting send limits (per hour/day) or sending email with content that the server does not like.
You need to find out what your email servers are telling WP Mailster. Please follow our troubleshooting guide on our site.
